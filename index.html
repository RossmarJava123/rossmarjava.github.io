						<div class="text">Photoshop CS6</div>
							<p>Adobe Photoshop is software that is extensively used for raster image editing, graphic design and digital art. It makes use of layering to allow for depth and flexibility in the design and editing process, as well as provide powerful editing tools, that when combined, are capable of just about anything.

								It was created by brothers Thomas and John Knoll in 1988. In 1989, John sold the program to Adobe Systems, which marketed it as “Photoshop.” Since then, the program has become the de facto industry standard for raster graphics editing. It is published for both macOS and Windows, but not Linux.</p>
